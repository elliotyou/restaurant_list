## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) have their own repositories. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers / Codespaces development container.

- For [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
- For Codespaces, install the [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://aka.ms/vscs-ext-vscode) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
